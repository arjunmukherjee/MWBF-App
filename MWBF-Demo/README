1. Change the Friendslist in the User class to be a dictionary
2. When a user tries to lookup a friend, we first lookup the users friends list. This is done by traversing the entire array of the users friends. Need to change this to a hash lookup.
5. Delete friends.
6. Add an option to register with Email only (not using Facebook).
7. StatsViewController : the quick stats and the picker both use the same code, but the code has been repeated across two methods, extract that out to a single method and call that instead.
8. Bug with EColumnChart, moveLeft does not work. Used in ActivityViewController.
9. Integrate facebook friends with the apps friend finder.


DEVICES
1. MapMyFitness (suite including all the mapMy apps). They do have a public api, client app needs to be registered (done), the user then needs to authorize (oauth1, oauth2) and obtain a token. Then issue rest calls.

2. Garmin
    They have an api, but it is not public. Garmin requires a one time $5000 fee to get access to their data.
    Exchanged a few emails with them.

// 1.4.10 build changes
1. Fixed issue with Challenge crashing the app (scroll to end was index array out of bounds for empty arrays)
2. Fixed issue with Add friend showing messy friends list (copying new array to user.friendsList, instead of assigning address and also clean out the cells array in the FriendsListViewController before populating it again).
3. LogActivityViewController : Changed the unitsLabel update from pickerChanged to pickerSelected
