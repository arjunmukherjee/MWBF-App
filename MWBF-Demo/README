1. Change the Friendslist in the User class to be a dictionary
2. When a user tries to lookup a friend, we first lookup the users friends list. This is done by traversing the entire array of the users friends. Need to change this to a hash lookup.
5. Delete friends.
6. Add an option to register with Email only (not using Facebook).
7. StatsViewController : the quick stats and the picker both use the same code, but the code has been repeated across two methods, extract that out to a single method and call that instead.
8. Bug with EColumnChart, moveLeft does not work. Used in ActivityViewController.
